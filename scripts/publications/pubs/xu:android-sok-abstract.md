The openness and extensibility of Android have made it a popular
platform for mobile devices and a strong candidate to drive the
Internet-of-Things.  Unfortunately, these properties also leave
Android vulnerable, attracting attacks for profit or fun.  To mitigate
these threats, numerous issue-specific solutions have been proposed.
With the increasing number and complexity of security problems and
solutions, we believe this is the right moment to step back and
systematically re-evaluate the Android security architecture and
security practices in the ecosystem.  We organize the most recent
security research on the Android platform into two categories: the
software stack and the ecosystem.  For each category, we provide
a comprehensive narrative of the problem space; highlight the
limitations of the proposed solutions; and identify open problems for
future research.  Based on our collection of knowledge, we envision a
blueprint for engineering a secure, next-generation Android ecosystem.
